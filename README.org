* Installation
** Manually
   1. Clone the repo.
   2. Add the repo path to your emacs ~load-path~.
   3. Load it when needed.

** From MELPA
   TODO: Melpa support.

** straight
   You can also install this package through the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] package manager.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (straight-use-package '(consult-eglot :host github
                                           :repo "mohkale/consult-eglot"))
   #+end_src

* Usage
  I recommend remapping ~completion-at-point~ to ~consult-company~ in company-mode
  buffers.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (define-key company-mode-map [remap completion-at-point] #'consult-company)
  #+end_src

  You can configure grouping and narrowing of company completion candidates through
  ~consult-company-narrow~.
